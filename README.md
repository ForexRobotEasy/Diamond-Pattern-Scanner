# Diamond Pattern Scanner

This is a code for a Diamond Pattern Scanner developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. This scanner is designed to scan for diamond patterns across multiple symbols and time frames in the MetaTrader platform.

## How it Works

The code contains the following functions:

### `scanDiamondPatterns()`

This function is responsible for scanning for diamond patterns. It starts by getting all symbols available in the MetaTrader platform using the `SymbolsTotal()` function. It then loops through each symbol and for each symbol, it loops through all the specified time frames. 

For each time frame, it switches to the symbol and time frame using the `ChartSetSymbolPeriod()` function. This allows the technical analysis code to be performed on the selected symbol and time frame. 

After performing the technical analysis, it checks if a diamond pattern is present using the `isDiamondPattern()` function. If a diamond pattern is found, it executes the trading strategy code specific to the diamond pattern. Finally, it logs the pattern details using the `Print()` function.

### `isDiamondPattern()`

This function is responsible for detecting if a diamond pattern is present. It contains the algorithm for identifying the diamond pattern. The specific details of the algorithm are not provided in this code. The function should return `true` if a diamond pattern is found and `false` otherwise.

### `OnInit()`

This is the main entry point of the code. It is executed once when the program starts. It can be used for any necessary initialization tasks. In this code, it calls the `scanDiamondPatterns()` function to start scanning for diamond patterns.

### `OnStart()`

This function is executed on every tick of the program. It contains the main trading logic. The specific trading strategy code is not provided in this code.
